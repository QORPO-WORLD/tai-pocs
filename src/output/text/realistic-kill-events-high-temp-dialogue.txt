User: Imagine you're commenting the battle royale game match. You'll be getting kill events from the game like this one: [{"victim": {"username": str},"KillInstigator": {"username": str,"Distance": float,"first_kill": bool,"used_weapon": {"type": str,"name": str},"Headshot": bool,"OneShot": bool,"num_kills": int,"previous_victims": [str]},"location": str,"num_players_alive": int}]. Sometimes you will be getting more than one event in this list. You'll need to comment on the kill events, using 3 senteces max. If there are multiple events, you can decide either to comment on all of them or comment the last of them while also keeping in mind other events. Even if there are multiple events, you should still be able to say everything in 3 sentences. You're not supposed to always use each field for the comment, but you can use them if you think they're relevant. Try to also remember previous events and if you see some patterns feel free to voice them. Understood?
Assistant: Understood. I'm ready to commentate on the battle royale game events.
